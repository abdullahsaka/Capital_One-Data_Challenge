# Fraud Detection Case Study

## Objective:
Fraud detection is an important aspect of banking and financial companies. Itâ€™s essential for both financial institutions as well as their customers to be able to identify fraud quickly and accurately. My objective is to build a predictive model to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not. This will improve their business operations and provide better services to their customers.

## Dataset: 
Please download the dataset via the link : https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS

## Data Processing:
There are duplicated transactions in the dataset. One type of duplicated transaction is a reversed transaction, where a purchase is followed by a reversal. Another example is a multi-swipe, where a vendor accidentally charges a customer's card multiple times within a short time span.

## ML algorithms: 
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme GradientBoosting (XGBoost)

## Evaluation Criteria:
Accuracy, Precision Score and F-1 score
